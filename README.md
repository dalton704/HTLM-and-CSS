<h2> Academy Cinemas</h2>
<br>
<p>Academy Cinemas is a basic website that I created using bootstrap4. It's an example of a home page for a movie theater called Academy Cinemas. The entire website only used bootstap4. I used bootstap components such as, columns, jumbotron, navbar, and more.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Dungeons and Dragons</h2>
<p>Dungeons and Dragons is the first website I created. It has a lot of basic functions like a navigation bar, Gallery, form input boxed, and more. The website also has a function Lightbox for the gallery. The input boxes are functional enough to where you can type in them but the submit button won't submit anything.</p>
